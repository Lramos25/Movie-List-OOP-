# Movie-List-OOP-
Read in files for actors or movies then create objects of each record to be stored in array. 

For this roject, I utilized a lot of techniques from my previous Python build.

Current methods work but I need to adjust so the header is not read as a record.

Still need to add the search and sort methods and will update once that is done.
